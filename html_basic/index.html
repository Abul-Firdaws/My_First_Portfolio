    <h2>Concepts and Practices</h2>
      <p>
        I have come across various concepts and practices in HTML, such as: semantic HTML, paragraphs, headings, and lists.
        These elements help structure the content of a webpage effectively, making it easier for users to read
        and understand the information presented. 
      </p>
          <h3>Understanding Paragraphs and Headings</h3>
            <p>
              Paragraphs are used to group related sentences together, providing a clear and concise way to present information.
              Headings are used to create a hierarchy of information, making it easier for users to navigate through the content.
              Lists, both ordered and unordered, are useful for presenting items in a structured format.
            </p>
            <p>
              This web page is a stepping stone toward mastering frontend development. As I continue learning,
              I will be adding new features.
